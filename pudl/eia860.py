    Given a year and EIA860 page, return info required to slurp it from Excel.

    The format of the EIA860 has changed slightly over the years, and so it
    is not completely straightforward to pull information from the spreadsheets
    into our analytical framework. This function looks up a map of the various
    tabs in the spreadsheet by year and page, and returns the information
    needed to name the data fields in a standardized way, and pull the right
    cells from each year & page into our database.

    Args:
        page (str): The string label indicating which page of the EIA860 we
            are attempting to read in. Must be one of the following:
                - 'generation_fuel'
                - 'stocks'
                - 'boiler_fuel'

            at the top of the sheet being read in, before the header row that
            contains the strings which will be converted into column names in

            in the year being read in, to the canonical EIA923 column names
            (i.e. the column names as they are in 2014-2016). This dictionary
            will be used by DataFrame.rename(). The keys are the column names
            in the dataframe as read from older years, and the values are the
            canonmical column names.  All should be stripped of leading and
